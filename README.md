# OctoOverworldSprites
Source for overworld sprites in Octopath Traveler
Currently only Sorceror Primrose and Starseer Ophilia

Installation:
Find the directory for Octopath Traveler pak files, which unless you have moved the steam install directory is usually under 
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\OCTOPATH TRAVELER\Octopath_Traveler\Content\Paks. 
```
You should see a single pak file under this directory.
Head over to the release tab, download and unzip the latest release.
Move the folder for the specific overworld sprite you want into this directory, and launch the game. The overworld sprites should be changed.


FAQ:

How I Managed This Mod:
Read the readme under technical information for a fuller picture of how this was acomplished.

Why I Wanted to Make this Mod:
After playing this game for a few times, I was quite enamored with how the sorceror job for Primrose looked, and wanted that sprite reflected in the overworld. 
I decided to delve into the game files in the hope that such a task could be done. This mod is the result of my findings and work.

Will You Add More Secondary Jobs Sprites:
Given enough demand, I might. Making and Adjusting the secondary job sprites to fit that of the base job sprite is in itself a challenge, but also to verify that the sprites are not
cut off in game and work as intended is a lot of work. I am definitely not a graphic artist, and making something that looks good requires a lot of trial and error. When I find the 
free time and will to make more sprites, More might come.
